to fix the no width after the floating element ( clearfix method )
  ::after{
      content : "";
      display : table;
      clear : both;
  }

selector "[]"
  eg : [class^ = "col-"] {
      selects all the which starts with the col- naming;
      class^ = with the start naming
      class* = with contain the naming
      class$ = end with the naming 
  }


Flexbox:
	flex-basis: just like width expect flex
	flex-grow : adjust the size with available space as ratio
	flex-shrink : opposite of grow ( small width than it set with)
	flex-flow : "direction" "wrap"
	flex : "grow" "shrink" "flex-basis"
	order : order of the set items
